Jogging from time to time
Different routes because same route is boring

Requirements:
 - navigation
 - many green places
 - combine with exploring your city
 - low traffic - not too loud
 - few traffic lights - you do not want to stop
 
If you go further:
 - special use case: you want to run with another person, who is a little bit fitter than you
